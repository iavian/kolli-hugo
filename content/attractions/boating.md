Another village on the way is Vaasaloorpatti, where the Government Fruit Farm is located. It is a beautiful place where paddy (the traditional quick-yielding dwarf variety indigenous to this region) is cultivated in the valley and a variety of hybrid and native fruits such as banana, jackfruit, oranges, coffee, pepper and spices are grown on the slopes here.

Not to be missed on the way to Vaasaloorpatti from Semmedu is the TAMPCOL Medicinal Farm at Vaalavandi Nadu, run by the Tamil Nadu government. The farm is surely worth visiting, as Kolli Hills is perhaps better known for its medicinal plants than anything else. A wide variety of medicinal plants and herbs used in Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani medicine are nurtured, cultivated, gathered and sent from here.
