The drive up the hill will take you to Solakkadu, the main town here, which is also one of the highest points in the hills. The viewpoint inside the Highways Bungalow compound is worth visiting, as one can have a spectacular view of the surrounding hills and plains from here.

Under the foot hills of the Kolli Hills many small and big towns exist. From these places the Kolli Hills is visible in a panoramic view and the climatic conditions of these places are influenced by the climatic conditions of the Kolli Hills.
